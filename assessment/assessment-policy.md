# Assessment Policy

## Unit

**Formative Assessments:**

The purpose of the formative assessments is to take stock of where you are at in the process of learning the unit standards. Getting feedback and acting on it is essential to being ready for the summative assessment â€“ therefore, once we start work on the summative assessment the formative assessments are closed.

* Assignments to develop skills, knowledge, and vocabulary.
* Usually focus on one or two of the standards supporting our essential tasks.
* Typically due within a day or two of when they are assigned.
* May be corrected and resubmitted up until the **summative assessment.**

**Summative Assessment:**

The unit summative assessment revisits the standards covered in the unit's formative assessments in a integrated and open ended project.

* A typical summative assessment includes:
   - Unit vocabulary
   - Design project
   - Coding skills
   - Collaboration
