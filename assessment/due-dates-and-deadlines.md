## Canvas Dates

* Available From: the date the assignment becomes visible to students.
* Due: the last date on which class time will be allocated for this assignment. This is also the date on which the assignment becomes eligible for assessment. I'll try to enter zeros for missing assignments shortly after this date and also to provide feedback on work submitted. Students who haven't completed the assignment may continue to work on it up to the close date.
* Until (close): After this date the assignment will no longer be accepted.
