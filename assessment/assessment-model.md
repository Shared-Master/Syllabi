# Essential Tasks, Outcomes, and Rubrics

## Essential Tasks

The six essential tasks summarize the core of work in computer science and related fields. The specific activities and types of projects vary with course. Most projects offer opportunities to demonstrate growith in several of the essential tasks. Formative assessments usually focus on one or two of the objectives that contribute to an essential task.

### AA: Applying abstractions and models

#### CS Principles

#### Game Design & Programming

### AE: Analyzing the effects of developments in computing

#### CS Principles

#### Game Design & Programming

### AW: Analyzing their computational work and the work of others

#### CS Principles

#### Game Design & Programming

* Reviewing games & game development tools
* Developing a critical vocbulary - understanding the frameworks and language that game developers have developed to understand and communicate about their work.
* Code reviews

### CP: Collaborating with peers on computing activities

* Using collaboration tools to facilitate a group project:
  - Google Docs
  - GitHub
* Dividing up work so that each member of the team has a defined contribution that can be accomplished with minimal dependance on others.
  - Knowing what you are responsible for
* Communicating about progress and challenges.
